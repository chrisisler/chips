# chips
Pure, composable, curried functions written for self-improvement.

## Why?
To practice writing unit tests and common functions like map, reduce, flatten, etc.

## Roadmap
* Provide an @example for every function.
  * Or a top-level EXAMPLES.md which describes the API
* Write more accessible comments.
* Allow `filter` to provide a second function to have a piped filter, like `map`.
