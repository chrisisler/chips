# chips
Pure, composable, curried functions written for self-improvement.

## Why?
- To learn by writing common functions like map, flatten, etc., and others like majorityPass.
- For personal use.

## Roadmap
* Use eslint
* Write tests for the following
    * `nPass`
    * `pipe`
    * `prop`
    * `reduce`
    * `values`
