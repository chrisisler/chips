# Chips
Chips is a functional JS library promoting succinct and immutable code.

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/chrisisler/chips.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/chrisisler/chips)

Chips delivers powerful functionality to support declarative logic.
* Compose methods to build custom functions.
* Each function is [curried](https://www.sitepoint.com/currying-in-functional-javascript/).
* Data is never mutated.

## API Documentation
There are examples for every function [available here](https://github.com/chrisisler/chips/blob/master/API.md).

## Install
```bash
git clone git@github.com:chrisisler/chips && cd chips && npm i
# or
npm i -S chips
```
Then in a JS file:
```javascript
const C = require('chips');
```
