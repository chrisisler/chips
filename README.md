# Chips
Chips is a functional JS library promoting succinct and immutable code by delivering powerful abstractions.

Chips methods make it effortless to write declarative logic that is simple to understand and painless to maintain.

* Compose methods with `map`, `filter`, and `pipe` to build custom modular functions.
* Chips are curried to provide a flexible and functional API
* Data is never mutated, a copy is always returned.

## Examples
TODO

## API

## Roadmap
* Provide an @example for every function.
* Put an Examples section and an API section in this README
* Write more accessible comments.
* Allow `filter` to provide a second function to have a piped filter, like `map`.
* Write `flatMap` and its tests

### Thank you Ramda
Reading Ramda source has taught me many tricks, so thanks to those guys.
