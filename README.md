# Chips
Chips is a functional JS library promoting succinct and immutable code by delivering powerful abstractions.
Chips methods make it effortless to write declarative logic that is simple to understand and painless to maintain.

* Compose methods to build custom modular functions.
* Each function is curried to provide a flexible and creative API.
* Data is never mutated, a copy is always returned.

## Examples
TODO

## API

## Roadmap
* Provide an @example for every function.
* Put an Examples section and an API section in this README
* Write more accessible comments.
