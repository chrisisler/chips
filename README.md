# chips
Composable functionality written for self-improvement.

## Why?
- To learn by writing common functions like map, flatten, etc., and others like majorityPass.
- For personal use and self-education.

## What's it do?
Nothing crazy or new. Chips are pure, curried functions employing immutability.

### Roadmap
* implement `filter` by using `reduce`
* Use eslint
* Write tests for the following
    * `filter`
    * `flatten`
    * `has`
    * `is`
    * `majorityPass`
    * `map`
    * `nPass`
    * `pipe`
    * `prop`
    * `reduce`
    * `values`
