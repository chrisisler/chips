# chips
Essentially, a bag of ~~chips~~ JS functions.

## Why?
- To learn by implementing common functions like map, reduce, etc., and not-so-common functions like majorityPass.
- For personal use and improvement.

## What's it do?
Nothing crazy or new. Chips are pure, curried functions employing immutability.

### Roadmap
* Write tests

### Don't use Chips
If you can't tell, Chips is a poor man's Ramda. Like, _dirt_ poor.
If you want actual functionality, just use a real library with 675 zillion stars.
Seriously, how did you even get here?
