# chips
Essentially, a bag of ~~chips~~ functions.

## Why did you make this?
- To learn by implementing common functions like map, reduce, etc., and not-so-common functions like majorityPass.
- For personal use and improvement.

## What does it do?
Nothing crazy or new.
Chips aims to provide flexible functionality by operating on as many data types where possible. For example, reduce operates on strings, objects, and arrays.
Chips are small, pure, auto-curried functions employing immutability.

### Roadmap
* Write `mapProp`
    * `mapProp('value', x => x * 2, { val: 4 }); //=> 8`

#### Don't use Chips
If you can't tell, Chips is a poor man's Ramda. Like, _dirt_ poor.
If you want actual functionality, just use a real library with 675 zillion stars.
Seriously, how did you even get here?
