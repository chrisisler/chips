# chips
Composable functionality written for self-improvement.

## Why?
- To learn by writing common functions like map, flatten, etc., and others like majorityPass.
- For personal use and self-education.

## What's it do?
Nothing crazy or new. Chips are pure, curried functions employing immutability.

### Roadmap
* Remove @sig signatures
* Allow `reduce` to properly operate on objects
* remove `curry1`
* Use eslint
* Write tests for
    * `allPass`
    * `alterProp`
    * `assign`
    * `filter`
    * `flatten`
    * `has`
    * `is`
    * `majorityPass`
    * `map`
    * `nPass`
    * `pipe`
    * `prop`
    * `reduce`
    * `toStr`
    * `values`

### Don't use Chips
If you can't tell, Chips is a poor man's Ramda. Like, _dirt_ poor.
If you want actual functionality, just use a real library with 675 zillion stars.
Seriously, how did you even get here?
